# Toxic Tweet Classification using Bag of Words and TF-IDF

Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a machine-learning project that aims to classify toxic tweets using the Bag of Words (BoW) approach and TFIDF. The Bag of Words model is a basic text representation technique 
that can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text classification. In this project, we will focus on identifying toxic tweets from a given dataset.
